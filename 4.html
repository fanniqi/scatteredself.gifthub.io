<p>
    I decided to keep it all. All the embraces, all the smiles, 
    all the laughs and the giggles, all the kisses, all the hugs, all the love. 
    I'll remember the color of your eyes, the tone of your skin, the smell of your hair. 
    I'll write a little poem to each of you. To every thing I loved about you. 
    <br>An ode. <a href="1.html">An essay</a>. A memoir. 
    <br>
    I knew this long before I came here. 
    Long before I met you. And yet I fell for you every time we met.  
    I wish I knew better but maybe this is the best I can do. To love without limits, 
    beyond borders and beyond time. Hope you got what you needed. While I tried to be everything. 
    A smile, a stranger, a refuge, a friend, a lover, a student, a mentor, a soulmate, a woman, a soul, and especially me. 
    Hope you felt the moment when <a href="index.html">the universe was looking at you</a>, 
    because for sure I've felt it when I was with you. 
    <br>And I'll look forward to the next time.
