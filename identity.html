<h4>Where does then belong identity into this? Oftentimes we see personal 
    identity being discussed as a <a href="6you.html">part of the self</a>, 
    but more of a form of its representation.</h4>

<p>Personal identity is stating the facts about our core - the self. 
    If thoughts are the defining characteristic of cognition, 
    identity is then a defining characteristic of the self. 
    In comparison to the self which has almost a metaphysical presence at the center of a human being, 
    personal identity is the acting of the self in a form of a physical and subjective phenomenon</p>
