<p>The internet has changed the way we experience our identity. <br>
    Some would say, that we as humans always interacted in a form of self-representation through different media.<br> 
    Everything we post online is then just a representation, a fragment of who we are.
    online presence we have on the internet is not just a mere self-representation act, 
    not an <a href="3.html">extension of us</a>, it is us. It is us in every phenomenological and metaphysical way we can imagine. 
    The human self has been interacting with the network in various ways, and it stayed there since the first moment of contact. 
    It is almost as if we created a small version of ourselves floating in cyberspace every time we interact with it. </p>
    
<h4>The past is just a <a href="3language.html">story</a> we tell ourselves</h4>
