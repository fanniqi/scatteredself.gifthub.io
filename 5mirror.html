<h4>Yeah, it could only be a reflection of you, but it wasn't really there.</h4>
<p>
I thought the same in the beginnig but then when I looked again,<br>
the other piece of me was living on its own. It wasn't like a mirror where the reflection moves<br>
together with me. It _moved_ on its own, as if it did not need me for the existence of I.<br>

The piece of me was more than a reflection. It continued on living its own life. <br>
It had its own interactions in the place I left it. It was as if looking at myself from a movie. <br>
The only difference was that the piece of me did not behave on a predicted storyline...<br>
I couldn't tell what it will do next.

<h4>So then it was someone else you were looking at.</h4>
