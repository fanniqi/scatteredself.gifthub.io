<h4>Yeah, it could only be a reflection of you, but it wasn't really there.</h4>


<p>
I thought the same in the beginnig but then when I looked again,
the other piece of me was living on its own. It wasn't like a <a href="3.html">mirror</a> where the reflection moves
together with me. It <i>moved</i> on its own, as if it did not need me for the existence of I.
        
The piece of me was more than a reflection. It continued on living its own life. 
It had its own interactions in the place I left it. It was as if looking at <a href="identity.html">myself</a> from a movie. 
The only difference was that the piece of me did not behave on a predicted storyline...
I couldn't tell what it will do next.

<h4>So then it was someone else you were looking at.</h4>
