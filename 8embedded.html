<p>
When you turn on your email, the cursor of your mouse becomes the fingerptip of your hand in <br>
the digital world. A digital finger of your mind.<br>
The presence of your <em>finger</em> is recognized by the device and that starts to interact with it.<br>
As if it took it and gave it a second life. This version of you that has been imprinted on <br>
the platform takes on new features and its information is being recorded and sorted.<br>

So in a sense, it becomes this new you. It is still you but also it isn't. 
</p>

<h4>You think we would not say that it is just a recording of my past interactions?</h4>

<P>It seems like it isn't. How can a past recording have a life on its own? Isn't it only static?<br>
    It would not undergo change, and it would not experience difference. But this <em>piece</em> not only<br>
    experiences it all, but interacts with the environment so the environment changes and adjusts <br>
    to accomodate this piece of me. It is indeed a strange interaction because it takes the agency<br>
    away from me and I no longer have to negage. This other me does it instead.
