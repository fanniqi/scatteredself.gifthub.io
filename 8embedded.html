<p>
When you turn on your email, the cursor of your mouse becomes the fingerptip of your hand in 
the digital world. A digital finger of your mind.
The presence of your <i>finger</i> is recognized by the device and that starts to interact with it.
As if it took it and gave it a second life. This version of you that has been imprinted on 
the platform takes on new features and its information is being recorded and sorted.

So in a sense, it becomes this <a href="5mirror.html">new you</a>. It is still you but also it isn't. 
</p>

<h4>You think we would not say that it is just a recording of my past interactions?</h4>

<P>It seems like it isn't. How can a past recording have a life on its own? Isn't it only static?
    It would not undergo change, and it would not experience difference. But this <i>piece</i> not only
    experiences it all, but interacts with the environment so the environment changes and adjusts 
    to accomodate this piece of me. It is indeed a strange interaction because it takes the agency
    away from me and I no longer have to negage. This <a href="identity.html">other me</a> does it instead.
