<p>The multiplicity of platforms we use to operate with a multiplicity of our small versions. 
    We may find the self fragmented and dispersed through these platforms, yet hard to piece together and make sense of it as a whole. 
    <br> 
    The self is some kind of a defining principle of <a href="self.html">personhood</a>. 
    It is the reason why we function as individuals, but looking from the outside, it is difficult to locate. 
    It is as if the self was hiding behind all the actions of a person but can not be observed from the outside nor found.

<h4>The self is a <a href="6you.html">mental presence</a>, 
    a mental someone that is existing on its own and is distinctive from others. </h4>
