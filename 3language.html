<h4>A piece of you...what part of <em>you</em></h4>
<p>
Language plays an essential role in our ability to express ourselves. <br>
The meaning is transferred into words that in their simplicity and with their own <br>
limitations try to explain the complexity of who we are.  <br>
Language helps us convey the meaning of what we believe describes us.<br>

So how else am I supposed to call it other than me?

<h4>so this piece that was you</h4>
