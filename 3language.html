<h4>A piece of you...what is <i>you</i>?</h4>
<p>
Language plays an essential role in our ability to express ourselves. 
The meaning is transferred into <a href="1.html">words</a> that in their simplicity and with their own 
limitations try to explain the complexity of who we are.  
Language helps us convey the meaning of what we believe describes us.

So how else am I supposed to call it other than me?

<h4>so this piece that was you</h4>

<a href="4space.html">where exactly was it?</a>
