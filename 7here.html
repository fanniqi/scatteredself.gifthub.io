<h4>Especially if they want to know I am online...</h4>
<p>
Precisely. If you were actually <em>online</em> you would most likely reply 'yes' to their<br>
message. But where were you in that moment? Were you there in the chatroom or were you <br>
just sitting by your computer somewhere on a chair? <br>
Or maybe you were in both places at the same time. Couldn't it be...?<br>

...that your mind was present in that chatroom while your body was physically present in the place<br>
of its location? That goes against all I ever believed about <em>where</em> I am. 
</p>

<h4>You can be changing locations then. Especially if something allows you to change location</h4>

<h4>But that still does not tell me anything about how you could lose a piece of you somewhere.</h4>
