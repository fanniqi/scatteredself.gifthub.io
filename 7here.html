<h4>Especially if they want to know I am online...</h4>
<p>
Precisely. If you were actually _online_ you would most likely reply *yes* to their
message. But where were you in that moment? Were you there in the _chatroom_ or were you 
just sitting by your computer somewhere on a chair? 
Or maybe you were in both places at the same time. Couldn't it be...?

...that your mind was present in that chatroom while your body was physically present in the place
of its location? That goes against all I ever believed about _where_ I am.

<h4>You can be changing locations then. Especially if something allows you to change location</h4>

<h4>But that still does not tell me anything about how you could lose a piece of you somewhere.</h4>
