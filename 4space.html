<h4>How could it stay there?</h4>
<p>
The space never seemed to bother me, because I never thought that other part of me <br>
could be anywhere else but here - where I am. The location of me is where I exists.<br>
But I told you... it felt like a part of me was missing.<br>

And later, when I looked back I could swear I saw it. <br>
For a glimpse of a moment there was <strong>I</strong> but it wasn't <em>me</em> there. I was just<br>
looking back at a piece of myself.
</p>

<h4>But what if it was only a reflection.</h4>
