<h4>How could it stay there?</h4>
<p>
The space never seemed to bother me, because I never thought that other part of me
could be anywhere else but here - where I am. The location of me is where I exists.
But I told you... it felt like a <a href="2.html">part of me</a> was missing.

And later, when I looked back I could swear I saw it. 
For a glimpse of a moment there was I but it wasn't me here. I was just
looking back at a piece of myself.
